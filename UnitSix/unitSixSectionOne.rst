Assignment 6 (chapter seventeen, section one)
=================================================

*7. Pull it all together—In Exercise 1, you looked at one topic in some detail. In this exercise, write a short paragraph about what you think is the right thing to do in the situation you selected. Justify your decision based on the analogy you developed, the costs and benefits you listed, and the duties in your table. After you’ve devised the best argument you can to show that you’re right, write a short description of what you think is the best argument against your decision.*
