General reading notes
======================

* 10 decimal is numerics, and sign/magnitude is +(n) or -(n) notation. Decimal notation is used for real numbers, and a decimal point separates fractional parts. Alpha chars for A-Z.
* Computers use an internal and external representation of these, what the machine sees and what we see are different.
* Internally, computers use binary.
* Binary is a base 2 positional numbering system.
* Decimal is a base 10.
* In a base 2 positional numbering system, the worth of a number is based on it's position, not it's value.
* Bits is the contraction of binary and digits.
* Any whole number that can be represented in base 10, can be represented in base 2, but it will take more digits to represnt a decimal digit in binary.
* To convert decimal to binary, we use the decimal to binary algorithm, dividing the decimal by two and examining the quotient. The remainder represents the binary of 1 or 0. We do this again until the decimal value has a quotient of 0.
* In every computer, there is a maximum of binary digits that can be used to store an int. Usually, 16, 32, or 64 bit systems.
* in an 8 bit, max value is 11111111. In 16 bit, it would be 16x1 for a total of 65,535 bits. Anything over this cannot be represented without a higher bit system.
* Attempting to represent a binary digit larger would result in a buffer overflow, or arithmetic overflow.
* One of the differences in math and computer science is that in math, a quantity can take any representation. Computer science deals with finite representations, and it has to handle errors for exceeding those.
