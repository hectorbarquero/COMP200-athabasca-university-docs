Assignment 4 (chapter four, section one)
===========================================

5. Again create a data file of random integers. Then write a program in the language of your choice to implement the selection sort algorithm of Figure 3.6 using file input data. Write a separate function (method, procedure) to find the location of the largest number in the unsorted section of the list (see Figure 2.14) and have your main function call that as needed. Write your sorted list to another data file.
