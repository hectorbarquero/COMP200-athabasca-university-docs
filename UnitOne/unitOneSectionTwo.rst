General reading notes
======================

* Psuedocode is an informal and natural way to express a program design. It's a design notation.
* High-level programming languages have a high level of abstraction from machine language, so they're close to plain speak, but they carry cryptic syntax.
* Psuedocode ignores the cryptic syntax of high-level programming language, making the transfer of an idea during the programming concept easier.
* Psuedocode is simple, highly readable, and has virtually no grammatical rules. It's often called *a programming language without the details*
* In psuedocode, it doesn't matter how you write your instructions. They just need to be clear, effective, computable, and unambiguous.
* A variable is a named storage location which holds data. It's often compared to a mailbox where you can place a value and retrieve it.

*Notes are ongoing, pending completion*


Algorithm discovery and design
================================
When you write psuedocode, it needs to carry three basic sequential operations:

1. Computation
2. Input
3. Output

Practice problem A
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An algorithm that gets three data values `x`, `y`, and `z` as input and outputs the average of those three values.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // declare variables x,y,z
   // create a function with x,y,z as arguments
   // in the function, return the sum of all variables divided by three
   // run the function which gets user inputs for x,y,z




Challenge work submission
===========================

1. Read chapter two of the textbook.
2. Complete challenge work #3, on page 88 of the text.


.. note:: 
   Corresponds to challenge work #3, on page 88 of the text. The instructions say a short paper, but the course Brightspace says 2-3 paragraphs is sufficient.
