Reading notes
==============

* Most fundamental work occurred in 1920 - 1940 under the branch of logic and applied mathematics.
* CS was not recognized until 1950 to early 1960.
* Theroretical computer science involves pencil and paper. Researchers investigate problems with formal models of computation.
* Programming is a tool of computer science, not the definition.
* Programming a means to an end, not an end in itself.
* Misconception 1: computer science is the study of computers.
* Misconception 2: computer science is the study of how to write computer programs.
* Misconception 3: computer science is the study of the uses and applications of computers and software.
* There is no single date that marks the beginning of computer science.
* The first general purpose electronic computers appeared in the 1940-1946 period.
* FORTRAN was the first high level programming language.
* Purdue university awarded the first MSc degree in computing in 1964, and the first PhD in 1968.
* Euclids algorithm deals with finding the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
* The word algorithm is derived from the last name of Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khowarizmi, a persian mathematician.
* Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khowarizmi wrote one of the earliest mathematical texts in the nineth century, giving us the word *algebra* from the arabic *al jabr*.
* German logician Kurt Godel theorized there are problems for which no generalized algorithmic solution can possible exist - an unsolvable problem.
* An unambiguous operation is one a computer could execute directly without further simplification.
* We call unambiguous operations *primitive operations*.
* Algorithms must be *doable*, or effectively computable. One algorithm may not be suitable for another solution.
* Sometimes an algorithm doesn't produce an answer, but it always produces a result.




Algorithms
===========
An algorithm is an unambiguous procedure or set of instructions for completing something, and requires a finite number of steps using primitive functions. It is a sequence of instructions that must produce an observable result.

They are imporant in computer science because if we can specify an algorithm to solve a problem, then we can automate its solution.

Algorithms can be one of three types:

1. Sequential operations
2. Conditional operations
3. Iterative operations

Computer science vs tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, biology is
| about microscopes, or chemistry is about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about the tools.
| It is about how we use them and what we find out when we do.

A definition of computer science
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| ? -> read page 6 of the text, the answer is here
| ? -> read page 10, note about computer science can be viewed as the science of algorithmic problem solving.
| ? -> read page 11 ctrl+f on "that is what computer science is all about."
